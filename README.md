# Project Overview
 For the Community project, I have created a multi-page website that is used to share a song that gave me a sense of community. This website features lyrics that contain animations that play on the words of the song. The song I have chosen for this project is called Lemonade by Jeremy Passion. This song represents the "Fil-Am anthem" which brings a lot of Filipino Americans together. It is also commonly known as a "simp" song, meaning romantic. Building this website was quite difficult as I explored different kinds of CSS styles. 

# Technical Overview
  - Current Status: 50%, applied all the code and missing touches to visuals.
  - Application: Visual Studio Code was used to create HTML and CSS code for the website.
  - Created with 5 types of HTML files for each page, and having an individual CSS file for each HTML.
